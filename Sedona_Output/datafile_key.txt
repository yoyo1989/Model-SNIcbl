Fiducial Model with 0.285 Ms Nickel
  file tag: "fiducial"
  bolLC = bolometric luminosity (I can also do V-band, if that would be better for matching phase)
  spec = spectrum (columns are time, angstroms, mu, and specific luminosity)
  we give the polar and equatorial viewing angle

Fiducial Model with adjusted Nickel mass to 0.47 Ms Nickel
  file tag: "fiducial_ni"
  To my eye, these spectra look bluer and spikier than I would hope for from a fiducial model. I'd be curious to know how they look to the observers.
