# Model-SNIcbl

Spectra data of the following SNe Ic-bl are added:
- 97ef: no GRB 
- 98bw: with GRB 980425
- 06aj: with GRB 060218
- 09bb: "engine-driven" SN Ic-bl, since it has been suggested to be a relativistic SN based on its large radio emission, similar
  to, albeit weaker than, nearby SN-GRBs, even if no gamma-rays were detected
- PTF10bzf (or 10ah): no GRB
